<div align = "center"><strong><font size="6">Reading Seminar on Stochastic Many-body Systems</font></strong></div>



**Organizers**: [Lei Li](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/leili/) (SJTU), [Zhenfu Wang](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~zhenfuwang/) (PKU) and [Shuyang Ling](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sling/) (NYU-SH)

This is a joint reading seminar about many-body systems and their applications.

The current topics include:

1. Uniform-in-time propagation of chaos.
2. Approximate message passing (AMP) for high-dimensional problems.
3. Applications of particle systems in machine learning.

All online meetings, if not specially marked, will be held in Zoom meeting room.

If you are interested in our seminar, please contact the organizers.
